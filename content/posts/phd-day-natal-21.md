The PhD Day activities held within the _6th Congress of the International Society for Cultural-Historical Activity Research_ represent how much the research community looks up to the future without neglecting the past.

In such a time of crisis and turmoil, it is refreshing to read and watch the work of talented young researchers. It is an opportunity for exchange that always goes in two ways. All the professors do their best to push the research further and help each PhD candidate develop and envision their own path. At the same time, the new and provocative ideas put on the table support the research community to keep moving further. _It brings fresh air to the flame._

It is striking the diversity of fields, backgrounds, and problems that the ISCAR community embraces. This diversity is one of the key strengths of this community. After all, the PhD Day is a safe environment for the new generation of scholars to present and try out new approaches and ideas.

In this edition, 14 out of 23 participants were Brazilians. As Brazil has a vibrant research community on cultural-historical approach, the engagement and participation of Brazilians would not be different. Unfortunately, we could not meet all in person. Natal is suited for this type of meeting in which we start the discussion in presentation rooms and continue it somewhere near the beach. But that was the only thing to regret.

I hope to see all the participants in Moscow to, once again, exchange precious
questions and ideas.
