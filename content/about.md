Hi!  My name is André Roodrigues.

I am an assistant professor at the Institute of Physics -- the University of São Paulo in Brazil. In the last decade, I have researched scientific concept formation, STEM education, educational data analysis with R, and cultural-historical psychology. This blog attempts to keep a consistent register of the journey as a researcher in the science education field.
